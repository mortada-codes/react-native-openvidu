     *
     * - `streamDestroyed`:
     *   - If dispatched by a [[Publisher]] (*you* have unpublished): automatically stops all media tracks and deletes any HTML video element associated to it (only those created by OpenVidu Browser, either by passing a valid parameter as `targetElement`
     * in method [[OpenVidu.initPublisher]] or by calling [[Publisher.createVideoElement]]). For every video removed, the Publisher object will also dispatch a `videoElementDestroyed` event.
     *   - If dispatched by [[Session]] (*other user* has unpublished): automatically unsubscribes the proper Subscriber object from the session (this includes closing the WebRTCPeer connection and disposing all MediaStreamTracks)
     * and also deletes any HTML video element associated to that Subscriber (only those created by OpenVidu Browser, either by passing a valid parameter as `targetElement` in method [[Session.subscribe]] or
