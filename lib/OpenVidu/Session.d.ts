     * For every video removed, the Publisher object will dispatch a `videoElementDestroyed` event.
     * Call `event.preventDefault()` upon event `streamDestroyed` if you want to clean the Publisher object on your own or re-publish it in a different Session (to do so it is a mandatory requirement to call `Session.unpublish()`
